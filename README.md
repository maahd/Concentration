# Concentration

Concentration is a memory game for the iPhone. You have an a bunch of cards and each of them has a matching pair. All the cards are facedown. You have to flip them and try and remember the card. After you flip two cards, both of them turn back down. If they match, they dissapear. The game finishes when you have matched all the cards.
